# System Design

Production-oriented system design patterns and architectural decision records.

## Topics Covered

### Architectural Patterns
- Microservices vs. Modular Monoliths
- Event-driven architectures
- API gateway patterns
- Service mesh considerations

### Scalability & Performance
- Horizontal and vertical scaling strategies
- Caching patterns (Redis, in-memory)
- Database optimization
- Load balancing and distribution

### Reliability & Resilience
- Circuit breakers and retry policies
- Graceful degradation
- Distributed tracing
- Health checks and monitoring

### AI System Design
- AI service integration patterns
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Fallback strategies for AI failures
- Cost-aware architecture

## Design Documents

Each design includes:
- **Context**: Problem and constraints
- **Decision**: Chosen approach
- **Consequences**: Trade-offs and implications
- **Alternatives**: Other options considered

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs document significant architectural decisions made throughout various projects.
