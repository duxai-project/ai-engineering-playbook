# AI Engineering Playbook

> Personal engineering notes and applied experiments in AI and modern .NET systems

## Overview

This repository documents my ongoing effort to evolve professionally in response to the rapid transformation driven by AI. It serves as a living playbook focused on practical implementation, system design, and production-oriented thinking.

## Purpose

The goal of this playbook is to:

- **Document Learning**: Capture insights, patterns, and lessons learned while working with AI systems and modern .NET development
- **Share Experiments**: Demonstrate practical implementations and real-world applications
- **Build Knowledge**: Create a structured reference for AI engineering practices and system design
- **Track Evolution**: Monitor the progression of skills and understanding in this rapidly changing field

## Structure

### 📚 Documentation

- **[AI Experiments](./ai-experiments/)**: Hands-on experiments with AI models, prompts, and integrations
- **[.NET Systems](./dotnet-systems/)**: Modern .NET architecture, patterns, and best practices
- **[System Design](./system-design/)**: Production-oriented design patterns and architectural decisions
- **[Production Notes](./production-notes/)**: Real-world deployment, monitoring, and operational insights

### 🎯 Focus Areas

1. **AI Integration**: Practical approaches to integrating AI capabilities into production systems
2. **Modern .NET**: Leveraging latest .NET features for scalable, maintainable applications
3. **System Architecture**: Designing resilient, observable, and performant systems
4. **Production Excellence**: Best practices for deployment, monitoring, and operations

## Getting Started

Each section contains:
- **README.md**: Overview and key concepts
- **Examples**: Practical code samples and implementations
- **Notes**: Observations, learnings, and decision logs
- **Resources**: References and further reading
