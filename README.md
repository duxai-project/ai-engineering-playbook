## Overview

This repository contains my personal engineering notes and applied experiments in AI and modern .NET systems.

It serves as a structured knowledge base documenting my continuous professional evolution in response to the rapid transformation driven by artificial intelligence.

The focus is practical, production-oriented learning rather than academic theory.

---

## Purpose

- Consolidate applied AI knowledge in one place
- Document architectural decisions and integration patterns
- Explore real-world implementation scenarios
- Strengthen production-ready engineering practices
- Build long-term expertise in modern AI-driven systems

This repository is not a tutorial collection.  
It is a working knowledge system.

---

## Core Focus Areas

- Applied AI engineering
- .NET backend systems
- Azure OpenAI integration
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Semantic Kernel orchestration
- Clean Architecture
- Performance and concurrency patterns
- Production-oriented design decisions

---

## Philosophy

Technology evolves fast.  
Engineering discipline must evolve faster.

This repository reflects a deliberate approach to:

- Adapting to AI-driven transformation
- Building enterprise-ready solutions
- Maintaining clarity, simplicity, and system thinking
- Prioritizing practical implementation over theoretical depth

---

## Structure

The repository is organized by domains:

- `python/` → Data foundations and ML basics  
- `dotnet/` → Architecture and backend patterns  
- `ai/` → RAG, embeddings, prompt design, orchestration  
- `azure/` → Cloud-native AI integration  
- `snippets/` → Reusable production-ready code examples  

---

## Current Focus (2026)

- Applied AI integration in .NET systems
- Azure OpenAI and enterprise-ready patterns
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Production-oriented architecture decisions
- Performance and concurrency discipline

---

## Continuous Evolution

This is a living repository.  
Notes evolve alongside real-world experience and project implementation.

The objective is long-term mastery, not short-term completion.
