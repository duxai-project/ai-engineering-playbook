# Restaurants API - Clean Architecture Playbook

This folder is a course-oriented documentation set for a Clean Architecture API implemented with ASP.NET Core and .NET.

## Goal

Translate Clean Architecture concepts into concrete .NET implementation decisions so you can:

- learn the architecture with real examples
- explain decisions clearly in interviews and technical posts
- reuse this documentation style for future course projects

## Reading Order

1. `00_overview.md`
2. `01_clean_architecture.md`
3. `02_request_flow.md`
4. `03_auth_and_security.md`
5. `04_data_and_infra.md`
6. `05_api_reference.md`
7. `06_testing.md`
8. `07_exercises.md`
9. `08_artifacts_catalog.md`

## How to Read This Playbook

For each topic, use this lens:

1. `In Clean Architecture:` principle or rule
2. `In .NET:` framework-level implementation
3. `In this project:` where to find it (file/class/path)

This keeps theory and implementation connected.

## Portfolio Intent

This documentation is designed to be portfolio-ready:

- concise and technically precise
- explicit about design choices and trade-offs
- easy to convert into LinkedIn posts at the end of each learning milestone
